## Overview
Every challenge has a solution if you are willing to pay the price. This project looked challenging at first but with every step and code, it became pretty easy. Google helped a lot along the way, I am pretty much a product of standing on the ladders of earlier successes of others.
I also realized through this project that there's usually more than one way to get to a desired destination and I didn't have to be too judgemental in writing codes.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon
Right now the social media links connect to mine. I'm friendly, feel free to chat me up.

## My process
- Added structure with HTML
- Built for Mobile First
- Built for Larger devices 
- Settled the social icons popup with JavaScript
- Ensured they was no bug
- Pushed to GitHub

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

- As much as I prefer using Flex, Grid makes everything more structured and ot could save time if I actually used it.
- Position: relative or absolute, is so under rated, I was stuck for hours in my code trying to figure out a mystery that simply took setting a part of my code to  relative and absolute to solve.


### Useful resources

- [JavaScript Media Queries](https://css-tricks.com/working-with-javascript-media-queries/) - This helped me figure out how to use media queries through JavaScript.
